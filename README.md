----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

Add the following in the playbook file

```
- hosts: all
  sudo: yes
  roles:
    - karthik137.docker
```


Requirements
------------

Add the following in requirements.yaml

```
- src: karthik137.docker

```
